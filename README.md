# README

This repository contains files that are part of the "CovidDeathsAndVaccinationAnalysis-2020-Feb2024" project, focusing on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization related to COVID-19 and vaccination. The data used in this project was obtained from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), a platform that collects and shares global data on various topics, including COVID-19 deaths.

Below is the structure of the repository and how to access the different resources:

## SQL File

The file `SQLQueryCovidDeathsAndVaccination.sql` contains the SQL code used for data cleaning and analysis. This script includes queries and operations to prepare the data related to COVID-19 deaths and vaccination for further analysis.

## Visualization in Tableau

The data visualization is available through Tableau. You can access the visualization by visiting the following link: [Visualization in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emmanuel.mena/viz/CovidDeathsandVaccinationsCasesAnalysis2020-February2024/Dashboard1).

Feel free to explore the data and visualization, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your interest in my project!
